**Bitcoin Price Prediction using Machine Learning in Python**
**Overview**

This project demonstrates how to use Machine Learning (ML) techniques to predict Bitcoin price movements. By analyzing historical data, the model generates signals that indicate whether buying Bitcoin at a given time is likely to be profitable or not.

Machine learning is widely used in financial markets to automate tasks like stock/crypto trend prediction, portfolio management, and risk analysis. In this project, we explore a practical application of ML in Bitcoin price prediction using Python.

**Features**

Data preprocessing and feature engineering for Bitcoin historical data

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Matplotlib and Seaborn

Machine Learning models implemented using Scikit-learn and XGBoost

Signal prediction for buy/sell opportunities

Model evaluation and performance visualization


**Tech Stack / Libraries**
